                        In Greek mythology, Daedalus was a well-known inventor, artist, and sculptor from Athens. It was claimed that his sculptures were so realistic,
                        they had to be chained down to keep them from running away. Daedalus was the father of Icarus, and the creator of the famous Labrynth.

                    <p>Icarus, the son of Daedalus, was known to test the limits of his father. The child was curious, reckless, and adventuresome. The child often
                        tested the inventions of his father, and his reckless behavior eventually became his downfall.
