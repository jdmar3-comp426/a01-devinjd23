                Daedalus, the known brilliant inventor, angers the ruler of the island of Crete, King Minos. Because of this, Daedalus is forced to flee
                the island. To accomplish, he uses wax to contrstruct two pairs of wings; one for himself and one for his son, Icarus. Before flight,
                Daedalus warns his son of the dangers of flying with these wings. If he flies too low, the seawater will dampen the wings and if he flies
                too high, the sun will melt the wax. Icarus, being the reckless child he is, ignores his fathers advice after a period of time. In the
                midst of his fun, he flies too high to the sun. The max eventually melts his wings, and he falls into the sea and drowns.
